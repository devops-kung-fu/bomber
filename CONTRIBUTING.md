# Contributing to SHS

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Use GPG to Sign Your Commits

Only pull requests that have been signed will be accepted.  For more information on setting up a GPG key for your Github account see the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/managing-commit-signature-verification).

## Contributing Code

All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests.  Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests and review regularly.  We practice a single trunk development method.

- Fork the repo and create your branch from main.
- All code requires test coverage. 100% coverage is the target Add new or modify existing tests.
- If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
- Ensure the tests pass.
- Make sure your code lints (go)
- Create a pull request.
